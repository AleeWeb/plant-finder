<h1>Creative Process and Execution</h1>

<strong>1. Evaluate and analyize data.</strong>

<p>I create questions to think before I dive into the code</p>

<h4>Who could benefit from using the data set?</h4>
<strong>1. Evaluate and analyze data.</strong>

<p>I examine the data set and size to see what kind of data is available. Then I create questions to think before I dive into the code</p>

<h4>Who would benefit from using the data set?</h4>

Answer based on the <a href="https://data.sfgov.org/Energy-and-Environment/San-Francisco-Plant-Finder-Data/vmnk-skih" target="_blank">DataSF website</a>: 

Anyone who is interested in:
- Greening neighborhoods 
- Enhancing our urban ecology
- Surviving the drought.


<h4>What is the goal of the data and application?</h4>

<p>To comprehend the data and to clearly communicate the data to the user. Make sure the user experience isn't confusing by balancing out the out animation and effects with clear and consise UI.</p>

<h4>What are the project requirements?</h4>

To search and filter San Francisco plants


<strong>2. Visual Brainstorm during the early stages.</strong>

<p>Quickly create wireframes, mock-ups/ Prototypes to visually brainstorm how I would like the app to look.</p>

<strong>3. Based on the data, project requirements and app purpose, I research technology options that will visualize the data in the way I would like.</strong>

<strong>4. Select the technology stack for the app and start coding!</strong>

<p>I went with React because an external API is used so using a "view" layer of the MVC just made sense to me. If someone ever needed to add a database for custom data or additional features, it would be easy to stack React with PostgreSQL, Django, MongoDB or something.</p>
