<h3>My Creative Process and Execution</h3>

<strong>1. Evaluate and analyize data.</strong>

<p>I create questions to think before I dive into the code</p>

<h4>Who could benefit from using the data set?</h4>
<strong>1. Evaluate and analyze data.</strong>

<p>I examine the data set and size to see what kind of data is available. Then I create questions to think before I dive into the code</p>

<h4>Who would benefit from using the data set?</h4>

Answer based on the <a href="https://data.sfgov.org/Energy-and-Environment/San-Francisco-Plant-Finder-Data/vmnk-skih" target="_blank">DataSF website</a>: 

Anyone who is interested in:
- Greening neighborhoods 
- Enhancing our urban ecology
- Surviving the drought.


<h4>What is the goal of the application?</h4>

<p>To clearly communicate the data to the user. Make sure the user experience isn't confusing by balancing out the animation and effects with clear and consise UI.</p>

<p>I tried to make the data interesting and fun by making the cards flip to display hidden data under the "Interesting Fact" section that I created on the back of the cards.</p>

<h4>What are the project requirements?</h4>

To search and filter San Francisco plants

<strong>2. Visual Brainstorm during the early stages.</strong>

<p>Quickly create wireframes, mock-ups/ Prototypes to visually brainstorm how I would like to layout the content for the app.</p>

3. Based on the data, project requirements and app purpose, I <strong>research</strong> technology options that will visualize the data in the way I would like.

<strong>4. Select the technology stack for the app and start coding!</strong>

<h3>Why did I choose React for this project?</h3>

<ul>

<li>To avoid reloading the entire page every time the data changes by using the <strong>React Virtual DOM</strong>. React only updates what is necessary making it FAST!</li>

<li>The <a href="https://data.sfgov.org/resource/">Plant Finder API Endpoint</a> is already hosted externally so I felt no need to go full stack for this project. I simply used the "view" layer known as React and pulled in the API JSON.</li>

<li>React provides modular code that is concise thanks to ES6 JS syntax!</li>

<li>There are so many awesome technology tool options, libraries and packages to use within React!</li>

</ul>
